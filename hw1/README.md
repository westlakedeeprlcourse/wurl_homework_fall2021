You need to complete the following files. The relevant sections are marked with "TODO".

- [infrastructure/rl_trainer.py](wurl/infrastructure/rl_trainer.py)

- [policies/MLP_policy.py](wurl/policies/MLP_policy.py)
- [agents/pg_agent.py](wurl/agents/pg_agent.py)

You will also want to look through [scripts/run_hw1.py](wurl/scripts/run_hw1.py), though you will not need to edit this files.

You will be running your policy gradients implementation in two experiments total, See the [assignment MarkDown](hw1.md) for more details.
